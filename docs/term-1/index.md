# Term 1: Foundational
Welcome to your first term at the Academy. In this term, we focus entirely on the **mental models** and **core tools** required to be a Data Engineer.

We will not be building complex cloud pipelines yet. Instead, we are learning the "Language of Data." By the end of this term, you will understand how data moves, how to control your computer via the command line, and how to write the two most important languages in data: Python and SQL.

## 📚 Course List

This term is broken down into four specific courses.

### [101 - Data Engineering Fundamentals](101-concepts/01-intro.md)
* **Focus:** Conceptual / Theory
* **Goal:** Understand the "Game."
* **Key Topics:**
    * The Data Engineering Lifecycle (Generation → Storage → Ingestion → Transformation → Serving)
    * The difference between OLTP (Transactional) and OLAP (Analytical) databases.
    * Batch processing vs. Streaming.

### [102 - Python for Data Engineering (Basics)](102-python/01-basics.md)
* **Focus:** Programming Syntax
* **Goal:** Learn to write logic and scripts.
* **Why this matters:** SQL can query data, but Python allows you to *move* it, *clean* it, and *automate* it. We focus on the parts of Python used for data (lists, dictionaries, loops), ignoring web development features.

### [103 - SQL for Data Engineering (Basics)](103-sql/01-select.md)
* **Focus:** Database Querying
* **Goal:** Learn to talk to the database.
* **Key Topics:**
    * `SELECT` & `FROM`: Getting data out.
    * `JOINS`: Combining different datasets (The #1 most important skill).
    * Aggregations: Summarizing data for the business.

### [104 - Developer Toolkit](104-toolkit/01-terminal.md)
* **Focus:** Environment & Version Control
* **Goal:** Stop clicking, start engineering.
* **Why this matters:** Real engineers don't drag-and-drop files. They use the **Command Line**. You will also learn **Git**, which saves your code history and stops you from losing work.
